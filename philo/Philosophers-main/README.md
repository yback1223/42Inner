# Philosophers
The dining philosopher's problem - the classical problem of synchronization
## The problem: 
The Dining Philosophers problem is a classic OS problem thatâ€™s usually stated in very non-OS terms:
There are N philosphers sitting around a circular table eating spaghetti and discussing philosphy. The problem is that each philosopher needs 2 forks to eat, and there are only N forks, one between each 2 philosophers. Design an algorithm that the philosophers can follow that
insures that none starves as long as each philosopher eventually stops eating, and such that the maximum number of philosophers can eat at once.

### usage: 
`./philo [Number of philos/forks] [Time to die] [Time to eat] [Time to sleep] [Must eat(optional)]` 

`./philo_bonus [Number of philos/forks] [Time to die] [Time to eat] [Time to sleep] [Must eat(optional)]`
